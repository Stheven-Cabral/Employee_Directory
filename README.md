# FEWD Tech Degree Project 8
Employee Directory

This is my project 8 for the Front End Web Development Tech Degree Program. It is a responsive employee directory that pulls data from a random user API. Once data is pulled from the random user API, employee cards are generated to include a profile image and minimal details. Employee cards can be clicked to view a profile that furthur details the employee. Clicking on the 'x' icon or outside the profile window closes the profile.
The page is responsive due to various media queries. At 768px resolutions and below, the cards are aligned all in a column and the contents are aligned in a column direction as well. At above 768px, the cards' direction and card contents are all in row. I used flexbox in order for the number of cards per row to adjust as the screen resolution changes.
Lastly, I wrote jQuery code to allow users to search for employees by name.
